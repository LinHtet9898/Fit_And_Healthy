    <h1>How can you tell if a lump is cancerous?</h1>
    <p><b>Has anyone ever noticed lumps or bumps on their neck or groin?</b> Our bodies are made up of numerous lymph nodes, and when we're unwell or when our bodies react to something, lumps can form. These may not only be lymph nodes but also fat lumps, which can appear as small excess pieces of flesh.

        Sometimes, certain cancers can be associated with lumps, but not all lumps are cancerous. So, I’ll explain how to differentiate them so you don’t worry every time you feel a lump. Common areas where these lumps appear are the neck, armpit, groin, and thighs. These lumps can range in size from as small as a pea to as large as a whole head.
        
        When lumps appear in the body, they can be regular lumps, cancerous lumps, or tuberculosis (TB) lumps. Regular lumps are usually round in shape with a smooth surface, and when touched, they feel soft and can often slip away from their spot. If infected, these lumps can become painful and swollen. TB lumps are like small rubbery bumps, often clustered together.
        
        However, cancerous lumps tend to have an uneven surface, feel hard, and remain firmly attached to their spot. These lumps grow rapidly in size over a short period. Patients with cancerous lumps often experience noticeable weight loss and a loss of appetite.
        
        This method of differentiation is not 100% accurate. To confirm whether a lump is cancerous, a biopsy, blood tests, and scans are needed. If you find an unusual lump in your body, feel free to consult the surgeons at My Medicine for further advice.</p>
