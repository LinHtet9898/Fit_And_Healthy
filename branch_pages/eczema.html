    <h1>What causes eczema?</h1>

       <p> Eczema is a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, and dry patches on the skin, and it is more common in individuals with dry skin. It is not a contagious disease, so it does not spread through skin-to-skin contact. However, triggers like allergens or improper diet can cause flare-ups of the condition.
        
        Eczema often starts in childhood and occurs when the skin reacts to something it is sensitive to, leading to redness and itching. It can present in various forms, including dry skin, itchiness, red patches, bumps, thickened skin, inflammation, and in some cases, flaking or scaling of the skin.
        
        Common causes include dust, pollen, soaps, harsh chemicals, animal dander, and scrub particles that irritate the skin. Interestingly, stress can also exacerbate eczema. It is more common in people who live in hot, humid environments, those who sweat a lot, people who work with water frequently, and individuals with dry skin or weak immune systems (e.g., people with HIV/AIDS, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, or those on immunosuppressant medications).
        
        Eczema can appear on various parts of the body, such as the hands, neck, elbows, knees, legs, ears, lips, and face. In children, it is particularly noticeable on the cheeks, causing intense itching and discomfort. Although eczema is not contagious, scratching can lead to bleeding, open sores, and infections.</p>
