    <h1>✴️Beware of Malaria Danger✴️</h1>
        <p>

            During this season, where mosquitoes are highly prevalent, in addition to dengue fever, another serious life-threatening concern is malaria.
            
            Malaria, which spreads through mosquito bites, is most commonly transmitted during the rainy season. Pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of experiencing severe symptoms‼️</p>
            
           <h2>Symptoms that indicate a malaria infection include:</h2> 
             <ul>
            <li>Chills</li>
             <li>Fever</li>
             <li>Fatigue</li>
             <li>Sweating</li>
             <li>Loss of appetite</li>
             <li>Headache</li>
             <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
            </ul>
             
           
           <p> Malaria often doesn’t show symptoms immediately after infection but can take around 10-15 days for symptoms to appear. If not treated in time, it can lead to fatal consequences.
            
            The best and most effective way to prevent malaria is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes:
            Avoid mosquito bites
            Use mosquito nets every night
            Regularly use mosquito repellent
            Wear long-sleeved, lightweight cotton clothes and long pants
            Lastly, to reduce mosquito breeding, ensure there is no stagnant water around your surroundings, and maintain cleanliness to minimize the risk of malaria transmission.</p>
